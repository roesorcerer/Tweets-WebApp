# Tweets Web Application Readme

This readme file provides an overview of the code for the Tweets web application. The code is written in C# and uses ASP.NET for web development. Below is an explanation of the key components and functionality of the code.

## Overview

The Tweets web application is designed to manage and display tweets with various attributes such as sentiment, confidence, negative reason, and airline. It allows users to perform operations like adding new tweets, deleting existing tweets, and viewing tweet details.

## Key Components

### Web Page

The code begins with a definition of an ASP.NET web page using the `<%@ Page %>` directive. It specifies the page's title, language, master page file, code-behind file, and class it inherits from. This page is named "tweets.aspx."

### HTML and ASP.NET Controls

The web page contains HTML and ASP.NET controls to build the user interface. Here are some of the key controls used:

- `<asp:HiddenField>`: A hidden field to store tweet ID information.
- `<asp:Label>` and `<asp:TextBox>`: Labels and textboxes for input fields, such as airline sentiment, sentiment confidence, negative reason, and airline.
- `<asp:Button>`: Buttons for saving, deleting, and clearing input fields.
- `<asp:GridView>`: A grid view to display a list of tweets with columns for various attributes.
- `<asp:LinkButton>`: A link button for viewing details of a specific tweet.

### Code-Behind File

The code-behind file for this web page is named "tweets.aspx.cs" and is specified in the `CodeBehind` attribute of the `<%@ Page %>` directive. This file contains the C# code that handles events and logic for the web page.

## Functionality

### Adding Tweets

Users can enter information for a tweet, including airline sentiment, sentiment confidence, negative reason, and airline. After entering the details, they can click the "Save" button (`ButtonSave`) to add the tweet to the grid view. The `ButtonSave_Click` event handler is responsible for handling the save operation.

### Deleting Tweets

Users can select a tweet from the grid view and click the "Delete" button (`ButtonDelete`) to remove the selected tweet. The `ButtonDelete_Click` event handler is responsible for handling the delete operation.

### Clearing Input Fields

The "Clear" button (`ButtonClear`) allows users to clear the input fields, resetting them to their initial state. The `ButtonClear_Click` event handler handles this action.

### Displaying Tweets

All tweets are displayed in the grid view (`gvtweets`) with columns for attributes like airline sentiment, sentiment confidence, negative reason, and airline. Users can also click the "View" link button to view details of a specific tweet.

### Success and Error Messages

Success and error messages are displayed using `<asp:Label>` controls (`SuccessMessage` and `ErrorMessage`) to provide feedback to users about the outcome of their actions.

## Conclusion

This code provides the foundation for a web application that allows users to manage and view tweets with various attributes. It uses ASP.NET controls and C# code to handle user interactions and data display. You can further enhance this application by implementing additional features and functionality as needed.
